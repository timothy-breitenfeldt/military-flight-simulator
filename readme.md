### Description

This was a school project in which I had to work with existing code to build a command parser. The functionality of the simulator was provided to me.

The application runs and shows a simulation of a airplane taking off from an aircraft carrier flying around and landing again, all driven by commands. It can take a script of commands as well so that you can create a realtime simulation as each command is executed in your script.
